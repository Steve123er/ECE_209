Generate_Grid is Problom #2
For the inputs to the functions of the states, the states are 1 indexed with 
x=1, y=4, h=6 the example input to many of the functions
mapping to 
[5,2,6]. in the matlab code I have.  
The outputs of the graphs are 1 indexed in the x,y convention held by the problem set.  
PDF has the functions that I used to answer that specific part of the problem.
